<H2>Problem F: Weights and Measures</H2><EM>I know, up on top you are seeing 
great sights, <BR>But down at the bottom, we, too, should have rights. <BR>We 
turtles can't stand it. Our shells will all crack! <BR>Besides, we need food. We 
are starving!" groaned Mack. </EM>
<H3>The Problem</H3>
<P>Mack, in an effort to avoid being cracked, has enlisted your advice as to the 
order in which turtles should be dispatched to form Yertle's throne. Each of the 
five thousand, six hundred and seven turtles ordered by Yertle has a different 
weight and strength. Your task is to build the largest stack of turtles 
possible. </P>
<P>Standard input consists of several lines, each containing a pair of integers 
separated by one or more space characters, specifying the weight and strength of 
a turtle. The weight of the turtle is in grams. The strength, also in grams, is 
the turtle's overall carrying capacity, including its own weight. That is, a 
turtle weighing 300g with a strength of 1000g could carry 700g of turtles on its 
back. There are at most 5,607 turtles. </P>
<P>Your output is a single integer indicating the maximum number of turtles that 
can be stacked without exceeding the strength of any one. </P>
