Problem</A></FONT></H2>
<P>Have you ever played Minesweeper? It's a cute little game which comes within 
a certain Operating System which name we can't really remember. Well, the goal 
of the game is to find where are all the mines within a MxN field. To help you, 
the game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are 
adjacent to that square. For instance, supose the following 4x4 field with 2 
mines (which are represented by an * character): <PRE>*...
....
.*..
....
</PRE>If we would represent the same field placing the hint numbers described 
above, we would end up with: <PRE>*100
2210
1*10
1110
</PRE>As you may have already noticed, each square may have at most 8 adjacent 
squares. </U></U>
<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A name=SECTION0001003000000000000000>The 
Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>The input will consist of an arbitrary number of fields. The first line of 
each field contains two integers n and m (0 &lt; n,m &lt;= 100) which stands for 
the number of lines and columns of the field respectively. The next n lines 
contains exactly m characters and represent the field. Each safe square is 
represented by an "." character (without the quotes) and each mine square is 
represented by an "*" character (also without the quotes). The first field line 
where n = m = 0 represents the end of input and should not be processed. 
<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A name=SECTION0001004000000000000000>The 
Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>For each field, you must print the following message in a line alone: <PRE>Field #x:</PRE>Where x stands for the number of the field (starting from 
1). The next n lines should contain the field with the "." characters replaced 
by the number of adjacent mines to that square. There must be an empty line 
between field outputs.
