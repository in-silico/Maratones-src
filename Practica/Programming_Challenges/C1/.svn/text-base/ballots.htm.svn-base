<H2>Problem D - Australian Voting</H2>Australian ballots require that the voter 
rank the candidates in order of choice. Initially only the first choices are 
counted and if one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, that candidate 
is elected. If no candidate receives more than 50%, all candidates tied for the 
lowest number of votes are eliminated. Ballots ranking these candidates first 
are recounted in favour of their highest ranked candidate who has not been 
eliminated. This process continues [that is, the lowest candidate is eliminated 
and each ballot is counted in favour of its ranked non-eliminated candidate] 
until one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote or until all candidates 
are tied. 
<H3>Input</H3><B>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by 
itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described 
below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line 
between two consecutive inputs. </B>
<P>
<P>The first line of input is an integer n &lt;= 20 indicating the number of 
candidates. The next n lines consist of the names of the candidates in order. 
Names may be up to 80 characters in length and may contain any printable 
characters. Up to 1000 lines follow; each contains the contents of a ballot. 
That is, each contains the numbers from 1 to n in some order. The first number 
indicates the candidate of first choice; the second number indicates candidate 
of second choice, and so on. 
<H3>Output</H3><B>For each test case, the output must follow the description 
below. The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line. 
</B>
<P>
<P>The Output consists of either a single line containing the name of the winner 
or several lines containing the names of the candidates who tied.
