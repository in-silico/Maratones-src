<H1>Problem B - Money Matters</H1>
<H3>Time limit: X seconds</H3><!-- author: Gunnar Kreitz -->
<P>Our sad tale begins with a tight clique of friends. Together they went on a 
trip to the picturesque country of Molvania. During their stay, various events 
which are too horrible to mention occurred. The net result was that the last 
evening of the trip ended with a momentous exchange of ``I never want to see you 
again!''s. A quick calculation tells you it may have been said almost 50 million 
times! 
<P>Back home in Scandinavia, our group of ex-friends realize that they haven't 
split the costs incurred during the trip evenly. Some people may be out several 
thousand crowns. Settling the debts turns out to be a bit more problematic than 
it ought to be, as many in the group no longer wish to speak to one another, and 
even less to give each other money. 
<P>Naturally, you want to help out, so you ask each person to tell you how much 
money she owes or is owed, and whom she is still friends with. Given this 
information, you're sure you can figure out if it's possible for everyone to get 
even, and with money only being given between persons who are still friends. 
<H2>Input</H2>
<P>The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N&lt;=20) which 
denotes the total number of test cases. The description of each test case is 
given below:<BR><BR>The first line contains two integers, <I>n</I> (<I>2 &#8804; n &#8804; 
10000</I>), and <I>m</I> (<I>0 &#8804; m &#8804; 50000</I>), the number of friends and the 
number of remaining friendships. Then <I>n</I> lines follow, each containing an 
integer <I>o</I> (<I>-10000 &#8804; o &#8804; 10000)</I> indicating how much each person 
owes (or is owed if <I>o &lt; 0</I>). The sum of these values is zero. After 
this comes <I>m</I> lines giving the remaining friendships, each line containing 
two integers <I>x</I>, <I>y</I> (<I>0 &#8804; x &lt; y &#8804; n-1</I>) indicating that 
persons <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are still friends. 
<H2>Output</H2>
<P>For each test case your output should consist of a single line saying 
<TT>POSSIBLE</TT> or <TT>IMPOSSIBLE</TT>.
