<H1>Problem A - Soda Surpler</H1>
<H3>Time limit: X seconds</H3><!-- author: Andreas Bj\"orklund --><IMG 
src="soda_files/p11689.jpg"> 
<P>Tim is an absolutely obsessive soda drinker, he simply cannot get enough. 
Most annoyingly though, he almost never has any money, so his only obvious legal 
way to obtain more soda is to take the money he gets when he recycles empty soda 
bottles to buy new ones. In addition to the empty bottles resulting from his own 
consumption he sometimes find empty bottles in the street. One day he was extra 
thirsty, so he actually drank sodas until he couldn't afford a new one. 
<H2>Input</H2>
<P>The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N&lt;15) which 
denotes the total number of test cases. The description of each test case is 
given below:<BR><BR>Three non-negative integers <I>e,f,c</I>, where 
<I>e&lt;1000</I> equals the number of empty soda bottles in Tim's possession at 
the start of the day, <I>f&lt;1000</I> the number of empty soda bottles found 
during the day, and <I>1&lt;c&lt;2000</I> the number of empty bottles required 
to buy a new soda. 
<H2>Output</H2>
<P>For each test case print how many sodas did Tim drink on his extra thirsty 
day? Look at the sample output for details.
