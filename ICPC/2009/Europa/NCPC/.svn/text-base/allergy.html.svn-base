<h1>Problem C - Allergy Test</h1>
<h3>Time limit: X seconds</h3>
<!-- author: Andreas Bj\"orklund -->

<p>
A test for allergy is conducted over the course of several days, and
consists of exposing you to different substances (so called
allergens). The goal is to decide exactly which of the allergens you
are allergic to.  Each allergen has a live duration <i>D</i>
measured in whole days, indicating exactly how many days you will
suffer from an allergic reaction <i>if</i> you are allergic to that
particular substance.  An allergic reaction starts to show almost
immediately after you have been exposed to an allergen which you are
allergic to.  The test scheme has two action points per day:
<ol>
  <li>At 8 o'clock each morning, at most one of the allergens is
    applied to your body.
  <li>At 8 o'clock each evening, you are examined for allergic
    reactions.
</ol>

Thus an allergen with live duration <i>D</i> will affect
exactly <i>D</i> allergic reaction examinations.

Of course, if you have two or more active allergens in your body at
the time of an observed reaction, you cannot tell from that
information only, which of the substances you are allergic to.
 
You want to find the shortest possible test scheme given the durations
of the allergens you want to test.  Furthermore, to allow simple large
scale application the test scheme must be non-adaptive, i.e. the
scheme should be fixed in advance. Thus you may not choose when to
apply an allergen based on the outcome of previous allergic reaction
examinations.


<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N<30) which denotes the total number of test cases.
The description of each test case is given below:<br><br>

The first line of the input contains a single integer <i>k</i> (1
&le; <i>k</i> &le; 20) specifying the number of allergens being
tested for.  Then follow <i>k</i> lines each containing an
integer <i>D</i> (1 &le; <i>D</i> &le; 7) specifying the live
duration of each allergen.

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case, print in a single line the number of days of the shortest conclusive non-adaptive test scheme.

<i>A scheme ends the morning when you no longer have active
allergens in your body, thus a test scheme for a single allergen with
live duration <i>D</i> takes <i>D</i> days.</i>
