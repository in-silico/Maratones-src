<H1>Problem D - Rain Fall</H1>
<H3>Time limit: X seconds</H3><!-- author: Mikael Goldmann -->
<P>Rainfall is measured in millimeters. The rain is collected in a vertical 
transparent tube with millimeter markings, and once the rain has stopped 
falling, one can check the height of the water in the tube. 
<P>In our problem, the tube unfortunately has a leak at height <IT>L</IT> 
millimeters (mm). If the water level is above the leak then water drains from 
the tube at a rate of <I>K</I> millimeters per hour (mm/h). 
<P>We want to figure out how much rain fell during a particular rainfall. <IT>We 
assume that the tube is high enough that it does not overflow. We also assume 
that rain falls at an (unknown) uniform rate during a rainfall, and that water 
does not evaporate from the tube. The height of the leak itself is also 
negligible.</IT> 
<H2>Input</H2>
<P>The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N&lt;40) which 
denotes the total number of test cases. The description of each test case is 
given below:<BR><BR>A line with five positive numbers: <I>L</I> <I>K</I> 
<I>T<SUB>1</SUB></I> <I>T<SUB>2</SUB></I> <I>H</I> where 
<UL>
  <LI><I>L</I> is where the leak is (mm) 
  <LI><I>K</I> is the rate at which water leaks (mm/h) 
  <LI><I>T<SUB>1</SUB></I> is the duration of the rainfall (h) 
  <LI><I>T<SUB>2</SUB></I> is the time between the end of the rainfall and the 
  observation of the water level (h) 
  <LI><I>H</I> is the water level in the tube when we observe it (mm) 
</LI></UL>Each number is at least 0.01 and at most 1000.00, and each is given 
with two decimals. 
<H2>Output</H2>
<P>For each test case print one line with two floating point numbers 
<I>F<SUB>1</SUB></I> <I>F<SUB>2</SUB></I> where <I>F<SUB>1</SUB></I> is the 
smallest rainfall in millimeters that would result in the given observation, and 
<I>F<SUB>2</SUB></I> is the largest rainfall in millimeters that would result in 
the given observation. Values with either absolute or relative error smaller 
than <I>10<SUP>-6</SUP></I> are acceptable.
