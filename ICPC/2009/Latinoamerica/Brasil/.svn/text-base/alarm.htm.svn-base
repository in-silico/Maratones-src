in a large hospital, which causes her working shifts to constantly change. To 
make it worse, she has deep sleep, and a difficult time to wake up using alarm 
clocks. 
<P>Recently she got a digital clock as a gift, with several different options of 
alarm sounds, and she has hope that it might help solve her problem. But, 
lately, she's been very tired and want to enjoy every single moment of rest. So 
she carries her new clock to every place she goes, and whenever she has some 
spare time, she tries to sleep, setting her alarm clock to the time when she 
needs to wake up. But, with so much anxiety to sleep, she ends up with some 
difficulty to fall asleep and enjoy some rest. 
<P>A problem that has been tormenting her is to know how many minutes of sleep 
she would have if she felt asleep immediately and woken up when the alarm clock 
ringed. But she is not very good with numbers, and asked you for help to write a 
program that, given the current time and the alarm time, find out the number of 
minutes she could sleep.
