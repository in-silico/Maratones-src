joint stock company, that is, a company in which every stockholder legally owns 
shares of stock that account for some percentage of the total shares of stock of 
the company. Due to the global economic crisis, the management rules of Envy 
Inc. define a particular way for distributing last year's profit: if a 
stockholder owns more than half of the shares of stock, he/she wins the total 
profit. Nothing fancy so far in this wild world! 
<P>Nevertheless, there are situations in which no stockholder owns more than 50% 
of the shares of stock of the company. So, in order to gain some profit, 
stockholders are allowed to form <EM>coalitions</EM>, i.e., groups of 
stockholders. The participation of the coalition, share-wise, is equivalent to 
the sum of its stockholders' percentile participation. Hence, if a coalition has 
more than half of the shares of stock, its members win the totality of last 
years profit. Then, the members of the coalition receive a part of the profit 
proportional to their individual participation in the coalition. 
<P>For instance, let us assume there are 5 stockholders: <SPAN 
class=MATH><I>A</I></SPAN>, <SPAN class=MATH><I>B</I></SPAN>, <SPAN 
class=MATH><I>C</I></SPAN>, <SPAN class=MATH><I>D</I></SPAN> and <SPAN 
class=MATH><I>E</I></SPAN>, owning <SPAN class=MATH>20%</SPAN>, <SPAN 
class=MATH>12%</SPAN>, <SPAN class=MATH>14%</SPAN>, <SPAN class=MATH>29%</SPAN> 
and <SPAN class=MATH>25%</SPAN> of the stock of the company, respectively. The 
stockholder <SPAN class=MATH><I>E</I></SPAN> could form several winning 
coalitions. For example, if <SPAN class=MATH><I>E</I></SPAN> were to form a 
coalition with <SPAN class=MATH><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN 
class=MATH><I>B</I></SPAN>, he/she would get <SPAN class=MATH>43.86%</SPAN> of 
last year's profit. If <SPAN class=MATH><I>E</I></SPAN> were to form a coalition 
with <SPAN class=MATH><I>B</I></SPAN> and <SPAN class=MATH><I>C</I></SPAN> 
instead, he/she would get <SPAN class=MATH>49.02%</SPAN> of last year's profit. 
On the other hand, <SPAN class=MATH><I>E</I></SPAN> could not form a winning 
coalition with only <SPAN class=MATH><I>A</I></SPAN>. 
<P>Your problem is, given a distribution of shares of stock of Envy Inc., and a 
stockholder, to determine the maximum percentage of the last year's profit that 
the given stockholder may win.

<H2><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><A

<P>The input consists of several test cases, each one defining a percentile 
distribution of shares of stock, and the index of a stockholder to determine 
his/her optimal participation. More precisely, each test case is defined by 
several input lines: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>the first line contains two integer values <SPAN 
  class=MATH><I>n</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $1 \leq n \leq 100$
 --> <SPAN 
  class=MATH>1 <IMG border=0 alt="$ \leq$" align=middle

  src="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/contests/232-b5f9a162/11658img1.png" width=18 
  height=31> 100</SPAN>) and <SPAN class=MATH><I>x</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $1 \leq x \leq n$
 --> <SPAN class=MATH>1 <IMG border=0 
  alt="$ \leq$" align=middle 
  src="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/contests/232-b5f9a162/11658img1.png" width=18 
  height=31> <I>x</I> <IMG border=0 alt="$ \leq$" align=middle 
  src="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/contests/232-b5f9a162/11658img1.png" width=18 
  height=31> <I>n</I></SPAN>), separated by a blank, representing the number of 
  stockholders in Envy Inc. and the index of a stockholder to determine his/her 
  optimal participation, respectively; 
  <LI>each one of the following <SPAN class=MATH><I>n</I></SPAN> lines has a 
  single floating point value <SPAN class=MATH><I>p</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN>, 
  rounded to 2 decimal places, which represents the percentage of stock 
  ownership of stockholder <SPAN class=MATH><I>i</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $1 \leq i \leq n$
 --> <SPAN class=MATH>1 <IMG border=0 
  alt="$ \leq$" align=middle 
  src="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/contests/232-b5f9a162/11658img1.png" width=18 
  height=31> <I>i</I> <IMG border=0 alt="$ \leq$" align=middle 
  src="http://uva.onlinejudge.org/contests/232-b5f9a162/11658img1.png" width=18 
  height=31> <I>n</I></SPAN>). The floating point delimiter is `<TT>.</TT>' 
  (i.e. the dot). You can assume that 
  <!-- MATH
 $p_1 + \ldots + p_n = 100$
 --><SPAN 
  class=MATH><I>p</I><SUB>1</SUB> +...+ <I>p</I><SUB>n</SUB> = 100</SPAN>. 
</LI></UL>
<P>The end of the input is indicated by <SPAN class=MATH><I>n</I> = <I>x</I> = 
0</SPAN>, an artificial case that must be ignored. 
<P>
<H2><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><A 
name=SECTION0001002000000000000000>Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2>
<P>For each given case, output a single line with the corresponding answer. The 
answer should be formatted and approximated to two decimal places. The floating 
point delimiter must be `<TT>.</TT>' (i.e. the dot). The rounding applies 
towards the <SPAN class=textit>nearest neighbor</SPAN> unless both neighbors are 
equidistant, in which case the result is rounded up (e.g. <SPAN 
class=MATH>78.312</SPAN> is rounded to <SPAN class=MATH>78.31</SPAN>; <SPAN 
class=MATH>78.566</SPAN> is rounded to <SPAN class=MATH>78.57</SPAN>; <SPAN 
class=MATH>78.345</SPAN> is rounded to <SPAN class=MATH>78.35</SPAN>, etc.).
