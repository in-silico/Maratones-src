<p>
In a distributed system, data is never where you need it, and fetching data
over a network takes time and consumes bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated
by adding a cache, where a node stores some resources locally and if those
resources need to be used again, it can simply take them from its cache rather
than asking someone else for them.

</p><p>
However, caches have a nasty tendency to fill up, so at some point, objects
must be evicted from the cache to make room for new objects. Choosing what
object to remove from the cache is not easy and there are several different
algorithms to choose from.

</p><p>
The marvelous Apes in Computing Machinery have come up with a fantastic new
algorithm, the Introspective Caching Algorithm, named after a city of Peru. It
consists of some extra hardware (a very small, precognitive monkey) which
helps making decisions. Since the monkey can see into the future, she knows
exactly what objects will be accessed and in what order, and using this
information she will make optimal decisions on what objects to remove from the
cache. Optimality here means that she will minimize the number of times an
object is read into the cache.

</p><p>
All object accesses go through the cache, so every time an object is accessed,
it must be inserted into the cache if it was not already there. All objects
are of equal size, and no writes occur in the system, so a cached object is
always valid. When the system starts, the cache is empty.

</p><p>
You have been tasked with evaluating the monkey's performance, and feeding her
the occasional banana.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file contains several test cases, each of them    as described below.

<p>
The first line of input contains three integers, separated by single spaces,
telling you how many objects fit in the cache, <!-- MATH
 $0 < c \le 10000$
 -->
<span class="MATH">0 &lt; <i>c</i><img src="I_files/11563img2.png" alt="$ \le$" align="MIDDLE" border="0" height="31" width="18">10000</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, how many
different objects are in the system, <!-- MATH
 $c \le n \le 100000$
 -->
<span class="MATH"><i>c</i><img src="I_files/11563img2.png" alt="$ \le$" align="MIDDLE" border="0" height="31" width="18"><i>n</i><img src="I_files/11563img2.png" alt="$ \le$" align="MIDDLE" border="0" height="31" width="18">100000</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and how many
accesses, <!-- MATH
 $0 \le a \le 100000$
 -->
<span class="MATH">0<img src="I_files/11563img2.png" alt="$ \le$" align="MIDDLE" border="0" height="31" width="18"><i>a</i><img src="I_files/11563img2.png" alt="$ \le$" align="MIDDLE" border="0" height="31" width="18">100000</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, will occur.  The following <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines contain a
single integer between <span class="MATH">0</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> - 1</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (inclusive) indicating what object is
accessed. The first line corresponds to the first object accessed access and
the last line to the last.

<p>
For each test case, write to the output the least number of times an object must be read into the cache to
handle the accesses listed in the input, on a line by itself.
