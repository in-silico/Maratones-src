<p>
We're building an old-school back-to-basics computer game. It's a very simple
text based adventure game where you walk around and try to find treasure,
avoiding falling into traps. The game is played on a rectangular grid and the
player gets very limited information about her surroundings.

</p><p>
The game will consist of the player moving around on the grid for as
long as she likes (or until she falls into a trap). The player can
move up, down, left and right (but not diagonally). She will pick up
gold if she walks into the same square as the gold is. If the player
stands next to (i.e., immediately up, down, left, or right of) one or more
traps, she will ``sense a draft'' but will not know from what direction the
draft comes, or how many traps she's near. If she tries to walk into a square
containing a wall, she will notice that there is a wall in that direction and
remain in the position where she was.

</p><p>
For scoring purposes, we want to show the player how much gold she could have
gotten safely. That is, how much gold can a player get playing with an optimal
strategy and always being sure that the square she walked into was safe. The
player does not have access to the map and the maps are randomly generated for
each game so she has no previous knowledge of the game.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file contains several test cases, each of them    as described below.

<p>
The first line of input contains two positive integers <span class="MATH"><i>W</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <span class="MATH"><i>H</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,
neither of them smaller than <span class="MATH">3</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> or larger than <span class="MATH">50</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, giving the width and the
height of the map, respectively.  The next <span class="MATH"><i>H</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines contain <span class="MATH"><i>W</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> characters
each, giving the map.  The symbols that may occur in a map are as follows:

</tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></p><p>
<table cols="3">
<col align="LEFT"><col align="CENTER"><col align="LEFT">
<tbody><tr><td align="LEFT" nowrap="nowrap" valign="BASELINE">
<tt>P</tt> </td><td align="CENTER" nowrap="nowrap" valign="BASELINE"> - </td><td align="LEFT" nowrap="nowrap" valign="BASELINE"> the player's starting position </td></tr>
<tr><td align="LEFT" nowrap="nowrap" valign="BASELINE">

<tt>.</tt> </td><td align="CENTER" nowrap="nowrap" valign="BASELINE"> - </td><td align="LEFT" nowrap="nowrap" valign="BASELINE"> normal floor
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>
There will be exactly one '<tt>P</tt>' in the map, and the border of
the map will always contain walls.

<p>
For each test case, write to the output the number of pieces of gold the player can
get without risking falling into a trap, on a line by itself.
