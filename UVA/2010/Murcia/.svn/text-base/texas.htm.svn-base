<P>John Anthony Good usually meets his friends on Fridays to have a poker night. They play
Texas Hold'em poker which is, nowadays, the most popular poker game. In Texas Hold'em,
each player may use any combination of his two face-down cards and the five face-up
community cards to make a poker hand. The player can use his two cards, just one, or none
of them to make the best hand.</P>

<P>A poker deck is comprised of 52 cards, organized in four suits ("Spades",
"Hearts", "Diamonds", and "Clubs") and 13 values ('2', '3',
'4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', and 'A', ordered from lowest to
highest).</P>

<P>The hands that a player can make are the following ones (from highest to lowest): 

</P><OL>
  <LI><B>Straight Flush</B>: five cards in sequence, all of the same suit. Example: <B>6H 7H
    8H 9H TH</B>. Note that the Ace can play low. Example: <B>AS 2S 3S 4S 5S</B>. Two hands
    containing a Straight Flush are compared by their highest card. The first example beats
    the second one. </LI>
  <LI><B>Four of a Kind</B>: four cards of the same value. Example: <B>AS AD AH AC 3S</B>.
    Hands are compared by the value of the four equal card values and, in case of tie, by the
    value of the remaining card. </LI>
  <LI><B>Full House</B>: three cards of the same value and two cards of another. Example: <B>7C
    7S 7D KH KS</B>. Hands are compared by the value of the three equal card values and, in
    case of tie, by the value of the pair. </LI>
  <LI><B>Flush</B>: five cards of the same suit. Example: <B>5D AD KD 7D QD</B>. Hands are
    compared by their highest card; in case of tie, by the second highest one, and so on. </LI>
  <LI><B>Straight</B>: five cards in sequence. Example: <B>TH JD QC KD AS</B>. Note that the
    Ace can also play low. </LI>
  <LI><B>Three of a Kind</B>: three cards of the same value. Example: <B>QS QH QC 2D 3C</B>.
    Hands are compared by the value of the three equal card values and, in case of tie, by the
    highest value of the remaining cards, and so on. </LI>
  <LI><B>Two Pair</B>: two cards of the same value, plus two cards of another value (that
    match each other but not the first pair). Example: <B>2C 2H 6C 6S 4D</B>. Hands are
    compared by the highest pair and, in case of tie, by the other pair. If both are the same,
    hands are compared by the remaining card. </LI>
  <LI><B>One Pair</B>: two cards of the same value. Example: <B>2C 2H 4H QH KD</B>. Hands are
    compared by the pair, and then by the highest remaining card, and so on. </LI>
  <LI><B>High Cards</B>: none of the previous hands. Example: <B>3H 7D JD QD AC</B>. Hands are
    compared by their highest card, in case of tie, by the second highest one, and so on. </LI>
</OL>

<P>John Anthony and his friends bet 5 euros each night and he always loses his money,
sometimes because he thinks that he has a lower hand than he actually has. Particularly,
he has serious problems when his hand is a straight.</P>

<H2><FONT color="#0070E8">The Problem</FONT></H2>

<P>In order to improve his poker skills, John Anthony has made up a solitaire card game.
He shuffles the deck and puts 49 cards from the 52-card deck faced-up on the table
compounding a 7x7-card square. For example, you can have the following case:</P>

<PRE>2C KC 3D 7S 7H 5D 6D
2H 7D 4H 4S TS 3H 8S
3S 5H AD 5S 6S 3C 9C
9S JC QC KD JH KS QS
6C 8H AC 2S 6H AH KH
TC AS 9H QD 7C 4C 8C
TH 2D JS 9D 8D 5C JD
</PRE>

<P>Then, he checks the seven rows (starting from top to bottom), the seven columns
(starting from left to right), and the two diagonals (first, the one starting in the
top-left corner and, then, the diagonal starting in the bottom-left corner). For each one
of these sixteen sets of seven cards he tries to select the combination of five cards that
comprise the highest possible hand (as in Texas Hold'em).</P>

<P>Now, he is asking you to write a program that helps him to check if the hand that he
finds is the highest one.</P>

<H2><FONT color="#0070E8">The Input</FONT></H2>

<P>The input consists of a first line with a number indicating the number of test cases.
Then the test cases are separated by a new line. Each test case consists of seven lines
with seven cards each one separated by blank spaces. Each card is represented by his value
(first) and his suit (second) without spaces between them.</P>

<H2><FONT color="#0070E8">The Output</FONT></H2>

<P>For each input case, you must print a line with the following information. First, the
line with the seven cards that include the best hand in the same order that they appear
(rows and diagonals from left to right, and columns from top to bottom). Then two blank
spaces, and the five cards that give the highest hand in the same order that they appear
in the line. Finally, two blank spaces more and the name of the hand ("High
Cards", "One Pair", "Two Pair", "Three of a Kind",
"Straight", "Flush", "Full House", "Four of a
Kind", "Straight Flush"). In case of two hands with the same score, the
hand that should be printed is the first one in the order in which the square and the
cards are checked by John Anthony.</P>
