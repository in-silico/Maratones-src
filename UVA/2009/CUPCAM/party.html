Party Night</A>&nbsp;</FONT></B></TABLE></CENTER>
</H1>

<P>
Today is the town's celebration day, on which tradition dictates that all townspeople go partying. 
Each of them should attend a party at one of the pubs, and dance and drink to the point of 
intoxication. Later on, once all the parties have come to an end, after-parties start being thrown at 
other pubs, and every villager then goes to one. In order for the villagers to make as many 
acquaintances as possible, no two of them attend the same two parties. 

<P>
Needless to say, such practice 
causes everyone to have a severe blackout regarding the events of the night, but people are still 
curious to know what happened. Unfortunately, all they seem to be able to remember is who coincided 
with them at some point, but they have serious trouble identifying when or where. And as their memory 
of even this piece of information may be shaky (to say the least), they need help in figuring out 
whether all their recollections are consistent or if, on the contrary, some of the townspeople must 
have made a mistake (either by failing to remember someone else who was there, or by incorrectly 
thinking they met someone they didn't). Can you help them? 

<P>
For example, in a town of 4 people, if we are told that villagers 0, 1 and 2 all met one another, and 
villagers 2 and 3 met as well, the data is consistent because there might have been parties <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>0</SPAN> and 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>1</SPAN>, and after-parties <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>0</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>2</SPAN>, such that person 0 went to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>0</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>0</SPAN>, person 1 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>0</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>1</SPAN>, person 2 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>0</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>2</SPAN>, and person 3 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I>1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>2</SPAN>; this arrangement satisfies 
all required conditions. However, if persons 0 and 3 claimed to have met too, the data would become 
inconsistent.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input file will contain several test cases. Each of them begins with a line containing two 
integers: <!-- MATH
 $1 \le n \le 100$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11706img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$"><I>n</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11706img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$">100</SPAN>, the number of villagers; and <!-- MATH
 $0 \le m \le 1000$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11706img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$"><I>m</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11706img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$">1000</SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> lines follow, each 
containing a pair of integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>, <!-- MATH
 $0 \le i, j < n$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11706img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$"><I>i</I>, <I>j</I> &lt; <I>n</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="11706img2.png"
 ALT="$ \ne$"><I>j</I></SPAN>, meaning that persons numbered 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> remember having been together in a pub. No pair of people will appear twice. Different 
test cases will be separated by a blank line. A line with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I> = <I>m</I> = 0</SPAN> signals the end of the input.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For each test case, print `<TT>YES</TT>' if there is a configuration of parties, after-parties, and 
villagers attending them under the conditions described, such that the pairs of people who met each 
other are exactly those in the input data. Print `<TT>NO</TT>' otherwise.
