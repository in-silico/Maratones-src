<P>
Some interesting documents have recently been found in the ACM archives. These documents contain an 
account of the original version of the ACM ICPC competition, which took place in Bletchley Park, 
England, in the year 1943. 

<P>
In this original contest, programs submitted by contestants were executed in a simplified version of 
the so-called deterministic Turing Machine, which undoubtedly most of you are familiar with. In this 
simplified version, the tape is not infinitely long. Instead, tape cells are numbered 0 to <SPAN CLASS="MATH">10<SUP>3</SUP> - 1</SPAN> 
(inclusive), from left to right. Also, the alphabet used is the unary alphabet, meaning that, prior to 
the execution of the program, the tape will be initialized with the string consisting of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> ones 
followed by all zeroes, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> is the numerical value of the input, and after execution the tape 
contents should be <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> ones followed by all zeroes, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>m</I></SPAN> is the numerical value of the 
corresponding output. In the beginning, the tape head is at position 0, and states are also numbered 
starting with 0, which is assumed to be the initial state. The machines work as usual: for every 
machine state <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN> and every bit <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> (0 or 1), there is a at most one rule determining what the next state 
will be if the symbol at the position of the tape head is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> and the current state is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN>; the rule also 
specifies the symbol to write at the current position and in which direction the head should move. 
When no rule applies, the machine stops. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Unfortunately, only the verdicts of the contest judge were found in the archives, there being no trace 
of the Turing machines submitted or the test cases used. Note that in this original contest, unlike 
the current one, there was a different verdict for each test case, instead of a general one. 

<P>
This discovery has caught the attention of the famous adventurer Zaphod Beeblebrox, who intends to 
launch a project to construct examples of machines and input/output ``files'' that might have caused 
these verdicts. Not only have all your efforts to make him understand the futility of such an 
enterprise failed miserably, but you also have been coerced into writing a program for him that 
generates such examples. Your program should receive a series of verdicts about one of the Turing 
machines submitted by the contestants, and return the specifications of a Turing machine, as well as a 
series of test cases, for which the verdicts are the ones you received. 

<P>
We consider the output for a machine should be `<TT>MLE</TT>' (memory limit exceeded) if the machine attempts to access any cell outside the tape range specified above; `<TT>TLE</TT>' (time limit exceeded) if it runs for at least 104 iterations without stopping or causing a MLE error; `<TT>WA</TT>' (wrong answer) if the machine stops but returns an incorrect result, and `<TT>AC</TT>' (accepted) if the machine stops and returns the expected result.

<P>

The input consists of a certain number (no larger than 30) of series of verdicts. The first line for 
each contains <!-- MATH

one of the words `<TT>TLE</TT>', `<TT>MLE</TT>', `<TT>WA</TT>' and `<TT>AC</TT>'. The end of input is signaled by a case with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> = 0</SPAN>, which should not be processed.

<P>
For a given test case for your program, your output should adhere to the following format: 

<P>
The first 
line contains <!-- MATH

 ALT="$ \le$">1000</SPAN>, the number of rules for the machine, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, the number of test 
cases for the Turing Machine.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>M</I></SPAN> lines follow, each one containing a rule, in the format <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I><SUB>prev</SUB>&nbsp;<I>c</I><SUB>prev</SUB>&nbsp;<I>q</I><SUB>next</SUB>&nbsp;<I>c</I><SUB>next</SUB>&nbsp;<I>mov</I></SPAN>. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I><SUB>prev</SUB></SPAN> is the 
state of the machine before the rule is applied, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I><SUB>prev</SUB></SPAN> is the content (either 0 or 1) of the tape at 
the current position <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> before the rule is applied, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I><SUB>next</SUB></SPAN> is the state of the machine after the rule is 
applied, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I><SUB>next</SUB></SPAN> is the content of position <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> after the rule is applied, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>mov</I></SPAN> is the direction in 
which the tape head moves one step after applying the rule (``<TT>L</TT>'' if it moves to the left and ``<TT>R</TT>'' if it moves to the right). The states should be integers between 0 and 1000, inclusive. The Turing machine should be deterministic, that is, there should be at most one transition from any pair <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>q</I><SUB>prev</SUB>, <I>c</I><SUB>prev</SUB>)</SPAN>, and should not be repeated in your output.
