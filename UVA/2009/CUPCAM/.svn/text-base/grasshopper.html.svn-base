<P>
We are at a funfair, where an array of trampolines, named ''The Grasshopper Labyrinth'', catches our attention. As the figure below shows, 
all of them are labelled with non-negative integers:

</DIV>

<P>
People are inside, jumping from one trampoline to another, trying to reach the trampoline in the northwest corner, where the exit to the 
attraction is located. If you reach the exit fast enough, you may win a prize. However, in order to be eligible for the prize, you must 
abide by the following rule: after leaping from a trampoline labelled with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN>, you need to get to another one <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>z</I></SPAN> trampolines away, in the 
same row or column. 

<P>
Therefore, your problem is to find the shortest path from any trampoline to the way out, measured by the number of 
leaps needed. Since the length of the jump from any trampoline is given, it is sufficient to label each trampoline with the direction of 
the best jump from it.

</DIV>

<P>
For a given starting position, a path is considered shorter than another if it requires a smaller number of jumps; in case of a tie, the 
path whose first step gets you northmost in the array is to be preferred; and in case of a tie, the one getting you westmost. 

<P>
Instead of 
these symbols, we are using the plain text ones: the appropriate cardinal point ('N', 'S', 'E' or 'W') for the arrows, 'X' for the 
trampolines without possible escape, and the asterisk '*' for the special trampoline at the upper left position, which represents the exit.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
Several cases are given in a single test file. The first line in each test case contains a pair of integers between 1 and 50, separated by 
a single space; the first is the number of rows and the second the number of columns in the matrix. Then, the entries in the matrix follow, 
line by line, each element being a non-negative integer, again separated by single whitespace characters. A <!-- MATH
 $0 \times 0$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0 <TT>x</TT> 0</SPAN> matrix will denote the 
end of the test cases, and hence should not be analyzed.

<P>

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The expected output of each data case is a character matrix. Each element is one of the allowed charset, ``<TT>N</TT>'', ``<TT>S</TT>'', 
``<TT>E</TT>'', ``<TT>W</TT>'', ``<TT>X</TT>'' or ``<TT>*</TT>'', as described above. The output for each case is followed by a blank line.
