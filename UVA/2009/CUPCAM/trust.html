<P>
The personnel department of <EM>Association of Cookie Monsters</EM> (ACM) has noticed that the 
productivity of various work groups in the company is not as good as it could be. They have 
interviewed the employees in the affected groups and they have detected the root of the problem: trust 
(or, rather, the lack thereof). Some employees do not trust the rest of the group, and this is 
decreasing their motivation and happiness. The personnel department wants to solve this problem, and 
has decided to reorganize the groups so that they are stable, i.e., they are formed by people who 
trust each other. They have asked the employees, and they know the people each employee trusts 
directly. Moreover, if employee <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> trusts employee <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> and employee <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> trusts employee <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>, then 
employee <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> will trust employee <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN>. And obviously, each employee trusts himself. They want to create 
as few groups as possible to reduce administration overhead (they also do not want to work too hard). 

<P>
With this information they have contacted you, and asked you to write a program that finds the minimum 
number of stable groups that can be created.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two positive 
integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> (<!-- MATH
 $1 \le P \le 1000$

 SRC="11709img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$">999000</SPAN>) separated by a single space. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> lines 
come next, each containing the name of one person. The names will have the following format: surname, 
a comma, a space and first name (for example <TT>McBride</TT>, <TT>John</TT> or <TT>Smith</TT>, <TT>Peter</TT>). 
Both the surname and the first name will be strings of uppercase or lowercase characters (with no 
blanks or punctuation marks), with a maximum length of 10 characters. There will not be repetitions in 
the complete names of the people. After the names there will appear <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>T</I></SPAN> blocks of 2 lines representing 
the trust relations between people. Each line of the block will contain the name of a person in the 
same format as before, and the block will mean that the person in the first line trusts the person in 
the second line. All people appearing in the confidence relations will have appeared in the previous 
list of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>P</I></SPAN> people. 

<P>
The input will end with the ``phantom'' test case `<TT>0 0</TT>', which must not be processed.

<P>
For each test case, the output will be a line containing a positive integer representing the minimum number of <EM>stable</EM> groups of people that can be formed.
