<P>
As is well known, an alphabet is a standardized set of letters, and a word is the smallest free form 
in a language; it can be written as a sequence of letters and symbolizes a meaning. Letters, as 
elements of alphabets, have a prescribed order, generally known as <EM>alphabetical order</EM>. The principle behind extending the alphabetical order to words (<EM>lexicographical order</EM>) is that all 
words in a list beginning with the same letter should be grouped together, and before any words 
starting with a letter 
that comes later in alphabetical order; within a group of all words starting with the same letter, all 
words beginning with the same two letters shall be grouped together, and so on; thus, when comparing 
two words for lexicographical order, the ordering is determined by the alphabetical order of the two 
letters at the position where the two words first differ. If a word is a prefix of another, the former 
comes before the latter. 

<P>
Here we are interested in a generic kind of words, bearing no relation with 
any specific language. Each of such, let's say, <EM>pseudo-words</EM> will be an ordered subset of letters (that is to say, no letter is repeated and it does not matter whether the word has a meaning 
in any actual language or not). As the set of available letters we will use the lower case (also 
called minuscule) form of the Latin alphabet, along with their standard alphabetical order:

<P>
Your task is to calculate the position of a given string (its rank) in the list of all the 
pseudo-words we can generate by using only characters of the string (remember that all of them are 
different), sorted in lexicographical order, as well as to find the pseudo-words corresponding to one 
or more given ranks.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The input consists of several test cases. The first line, for each of them, contains a string of 
(distinct) characters of the Latin alphabet in lower case (`<TT>a</TT> - <TT>z</TT>'). The length of such a 
string will be between 1 and 20, inclusive. The following lines will contain an integer between 1 and 
the total number of pseudo-words that is possible to form with the letters of the string, until a new 
string is found or the input file ends.

<P>

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
For each test case, output a line with the rank of the input string in the list of all pseudo-words, 
and then print in a line by itself each of the pseudo-words ranked at the positions of the 
corresponding input numbers.
