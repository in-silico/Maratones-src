<h2><font color="#0070E8">Context</font></h2>

<p>A <b>family tree</b> is a chart representing family relationships in a conventional
tree structure. The more detailed family trees used in medicine, genealogy, and social
work are known as genograms. Several <b>genealogical numbering systems</b> have been
widely adopted for presenting family trees. Some of them are <span class="mw-headline"><em>ascending</em>
numbering systems.</span></p>

<p>Ahnentafel, also known as the <b>Eytzinger Method</b>, <b>Sosa Method</b>, and <b>Sosa-Stradonitz
Method</b>, allows for the numbering of ancestors beginning with a descendant. This system
allows one to derive an ancestor's number without compiling the list, and allows one to
derive an ancestor's relationship based on their numbers.</p>

<p>The number of a person's father is the double of his own number, and the number of a
person's mother is the double of his own plus one. For instance, if the number of John
Smith is 10, his father is 20, and his mother is 21.</p>

<p>The first 15 numbers, identifying individuals in 4 generations, are as follows:</p>

<pre>(First Generation)
 1  Subject

(Second Generation)
 2  Father
 3  Mother

(Third Generation)
 4  Father's father
 5  Father's mother
 6  Mother's father
 7  Mother's mother

(Fourth Generation)
 8  Father's father's father
 9  Father's father's mother
10  Father's mother's father
11  Father's mother's mother
12  Mother's father's father
13  Mother's father's mother
14  Mother's mother's father
15  Mother's mother's mother
</pre>

<p>It is possible (and usual) that two or more individuals are the same, and so are the
ancestors.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Complete binary tree for four generations</em></p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Problem</font></h2>

<p>We have built our complete family tree, including until the <em>N</em>-th generation.
But we have found out that two of our ancestors are brothers (they have the same parents).</p>

<p>We want to know the amount of different people of our family tree (including us).</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Input</font></h2>

<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <em>T</em> indicating the number of
test cases. For each test case, there is a line with three positive integer numbers <i>N,
A</i> and <i>B</i>,<span lang="EN"> separated by blanks, (4</span>&lt;=<em>N</em>&lt;=20),
where&nbsp;<i>N</i> is the number of generations, and <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are brothers
with the same parents.</p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">The Output</font></h2>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">For each test case, the output should
consist of one integer indicating the amount of different people of our family tree
(including us).</font></span></h2>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">Sample Input</font></h2>

<pre>3
4 4 12
4 4 6
5 2 3
</pre>

<h2><font color="#0070E8">Sample Output</font></h2>

<pre>15
13
17
