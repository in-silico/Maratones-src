<P>
The court of King Xeon 2.4 is plagued with intrigue and conspiracy. A document
recently discovered by the King's Secret Service is thought to be part of some
mischievous scheme. The document contains simply a set of sentences which state
the truth or falsehood of each other. Sentences have the form ``Sentence X is
true/false" where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> identifies one sentence in the set. The King's Secret Service
suspects the sentences in fact refer to another, yet uncovered, document.

<P>
While they try to establish the origin and purpose of the document, the King ordered
you to find whether the set of sentences it contains is consistent, that is, if there
is a valid truth assignment for the sentences. If the set is consistent, the King
wants you to determine the maximum number of sentences which can be made true in a
valid truth assignment for the document.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The input file contains several instances of documents. Each document starts
with a line containing a single integer, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN>, which indicates the number of
sentences in the document (<!-- MATH
 $1 \leq N \leq 1000$

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1 <IMG

 SRC="2612img1.gif"
 ALT="$ \leq$"> 1000</SPAN>). The following <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> lines contain
each a sentence. Sentences are numbered sequentially, in the order they appear in
the input (the first is sentence 1, the second is sentence 2, and so on). Each
sentence has the form `<TT>Sentence X is true.</TT>' or `<TT>Sentence X is false.</TT>',
where <!-- MATH

<P>
For each document in the input your program should output one line. If the document
is consistent, your program should print the maximum number of sentences in a valid
truth assignment for the document. Otherwise your program should print the word
`<TT>Inconsistent</TT>'.
