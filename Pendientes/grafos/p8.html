Locks and keys</A>&nbsp;</FONT></B></TABLE></CENTER>

<P>
A wizard is in a labyrinth where there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> rooms and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I> - 1</SPAN> doors
connecting some pairs of rooms in both directions, in such a way that there is always a sequence of
doors one can traverse to go from a room to any other room. Additionally, there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> locks and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> keys of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> different colours 
(one of each) in some of the
doors and rooms of the maze, respectively; each door has at most one lock, and
there is at most one key placed in each room. It should be an easy matter for the wizard to bypass the lock
system, were it not for the fact that he forgot his spell book, without
which his wizardry is utterly useless. The wizard is currently in room <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>, and he wants to get his
spell book, located in room <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>, without taking too long. At every step he may go to an adjacent room through one of the doors. Of course,
if the door is locked, he needs to be carrying the key of the same colour as the lock (unless, of
    course, that door has already been unlocked). The wizard can carry only one key at a time
and after picking up a key it is not possible for him to drop it somewhere in the
maze in order to take it again afterwards. Once a door has been unlocked, the key is thrown away since it is no
longer any use.

<P>
Given the maze and the positions of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> keys and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> locks, determine how to reach <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN>,
if possible. Any path whose length does not exceed <!-- MATH
 $4 \cdot (C + 1) \cdot V$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">4<SUP> . </SUP>(<I>C</I> + 1)<SUP> . </SUP><I>V</I></SPAN> is acceptable.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
The first line of each case contains four integers: the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> of rooms in the maze (<!-- MATH
 $1 \le V
\le 1\,500$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="4962img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$"><I>V</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="4962img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$">1&nbsp;500</SPAN>), the number <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> of locks (<!-- MATH
 $0 \le C < V$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="4962img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$"><I>C</I> &lt; <I>V</I></SPAN>), and rooms <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN> numbered
<!-- MATH
 $0,1,\ldots,V-1$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0, 1,..., <I>V</I> - 1</SPAN>. Then comes a (possibly empty) line with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I></SPAN> integers indicating the location of
each of the keys, in order of increasing colour. The next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I> - 1</SPAN> lines describe the maze: each
contains three integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I>&nbsp;<I>B</I>&nbsp;<I>L</I></SPAN>, meaning that there is a door between rooms <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I></SPAN> which can
be unlocked with the key of colour <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>, if <!-- MATH
 $0 \le L < C$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">0<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="4962img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$"><I>L</I> &lt; <I>C</I></SPAN>; a value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH">-1</SPAN> for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN> indicates that no
lock is needed.

<P>
The last line has <!-- MATH
 $V, C, X, Y = 0, 0, 0, 0$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I>, <I>C</I>, <I>X</I>, <I>Y</I> = 0, 0, 0, 0</SPAN>.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>
There is one line of output per test case. If there is no solution, output `<TT>Impossible</TT>'. Otherwise
print the full path corresponding to your solution in the format <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I></SPAN>:<!-- MATH
 $\,V_0 \ldots V_L$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">&nbsp;<I>V</I><SUB>0</SUB>...<I>V</I><SUB>L</SUB></SPAN>, where <!-- MATH
 $L
\le 4 (C + 1) V$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I><IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="4962img1.png"
 ALT="$ \le$">4(<I>C</I> + 1)<I>V</I></SPAN> is the length of a path from <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I></SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Y</I></SPAN>,
and <!-- MATH
 $X = V_0, V_1, \ldots, V_{L-1}, V_L = Y$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>X</I> = <I>V</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>V</I><SUB>1</SUB>,..., <I>V</I><SUB>L-1</SUB>, <I>V</I><SUB>L</SUB> = <I>Y</I></SPAN> is the sequence of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>L</I> + 1</SPAN> vertices visited in the right order.
A single space must precede each vertex in the path; see sample output for clarification.
