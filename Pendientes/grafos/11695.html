<h1>Problem G - Flight Planning</h1>
<h3>Time limit: X seconds</h3>
<!-- author: Jimmy Mårdell -->

<p>
The airline company NCPC Airways has flights to and from <i>n</i>
cities, numbered from 1 to <i>n</i>, around the entire world. However,
they only have <i>n - 1</i> different flights (operating in both
directions), so in order to travel between any two cities you might
have to take several flights. In fact, since the management has made
sure that it's possible to travel between any pair of cities, there is
exactly one set of flights a passenger have to take in order to travel
between two cities (assuming you want to use the same airline).

<p>
Recently many of NCPC Airways frequent flyers have complained that
they have had to change flights too often to get to their final
destination. Since NCPC Airways doesn't want to loose their customers
to other airline companies, but still keep the nice property of their
flights, they have decided to cancel one of their current flights and
replace it with another flight. Help the company by writing a program
which finds the best flight to cancel and the best new flight to add
so that the maximum number of flight changes a passenger might have to
make when travelling between any pair of cities in which NCPC Airways
operates is minimized.

<p>
<i>The input will be constructed so that it is always possible to
improve the maximum number of flight changes needed.</i>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer N (N<20) which denotes the total number of test cases.
The description of each test case is given below:<br><br>

The first line of input for each test case contains the integer <i>n</i> (<i>4 &le; n
&le; 2500</i>), the number of cities NCPC Airways operates in.  Then
follow <i>n - 1</i> lines specifying the flights. Each flight is given
as a pair of cities <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (<i>1 &le; a, b &le; n</i>).

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case print three lines of output. The first line should
contain an integer, the minimum number of flights needed to take when
travelling between any pair of cities after changing one of the
flights.  The second line should contain two integers, specifying the
two cities between which the flight should be canceled.  The third
line should contain two integers, specifying the two cities where a
new flight should be added.

<p>
If there are more than one optimal solution, any one of them will be accepted.
