<h2>Problem D: Knight's Trip</h2>

<img src="p11852.png" align=right>

In chess, each move of a knight consists of moving by two squares
horizontally and one square vertically, or by one square horizontally
and two squares vertically. A knight making one move from location (0,0) of an
infinite chess board would end up at one of the following eight locations:
(1,2), 
(-1,2), 
(1,-2), 
(-1,-2), 
(2,1),
(-2,1),
(2,-1),
(-2,-1).
<p>
Starting from location (0,0), what is the minimum number of moves required
for a knight to get to some other arbitrary location (x,y)?

<h3>Input Specification</h3>
Each line of input contains two integers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, each with
absolute value at most one billion. The integers designate a location
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) on the infinite chess board.
The final line contains the word <tt>END</tt>.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
1 2
2 4
END
</pre>

<h3>Output Specification</h3>
For each location in the input, output a line containing one integer,
the minimum number of moves required for a knight to move from
(0,0) to (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>).
