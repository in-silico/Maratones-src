Indiana Jones is in a deserted city, annihilated during a war. Roofs of all
houses have been destroyed and only portions of walls are still standing.
The ground is so full of mines that the only safe way to move around the city
is walking over the remaining walls. The mission of our hero is to save a person
who is trapped in the city. In order to move between two walls which are not
connected Indiana Jones thought of taking with him a wooden board which he
could place between the two walls and then cross from one to the other.

Initial positions of Indiana Jones and the trapped person are both on some section
of the walls.  Besides, walls are either in the direction South-North or West-East.

</p><p>
You will be given a map of the city remains. Your mission is to determine the minimum
length of the wooden board Indiana Jones needs to carry in order to get to the trapped
person.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Your program should process several test cases. Each test case starts with an integer
<span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> indicating the number of wall sections remaining in the city (<!-- MATH
 $2 \leq N \leq 1000$
 -->
<span class="MATH">2 <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./2613_files/2613img2.gif" alt="$ \leq$"> <i>N</i> <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./2613_files/2613img2.gif" alt="$ \leq$"> 1000</span>).
Each of the next <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> lines describes a wall section. The first wall section to appear
is the section where Indiana Jones stands at the beginning.  The second section to
appear is the section where the trapped person stands. Each wall section description
consists of three integers <span class="MATH"><i>X</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>Y</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> <!-- MATH
 $(­10000 \leq X, Y, L \leq 10000)$

<span class="MATH">(­10000 <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./2613_files/2613img2.gif" alt="$ \leq$"> <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>, <i>L</i> <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./2613_files/2613img2.gif" alt="$ \leq$"> 10000)</span>,
where <span class="MATH"><i>X</i></span> an <span class="MATH"><i>Y</i></span> define either the southernmost point of a wall section (for South-North
sections) or the westernmost point (for West-East wall sections). The value of <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>
determines the length and direction of the wall: if <span class="MATH"><i>L</i> <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./2613_files/2613img3.gif" alt="$ \geq$"> 0</span>, the section is West-East,
with length <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>; if <span class="MATH"><i>L</i> &lt; 0</span>, the section is North-South, with length <span class="MATH">| <i>L</i>|</span>.
The end of input is indicated by <span class="MATH"><i>N</i> = 0</span>.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each test case in the input your program should produce one line of output,
containing a real value representing the length of the wooden board Indiana Jones
must carry. The length must be printed as a real number with two-digit precision,
and the last decimal digit must be rounded. The input will not contain test cases
where differences in rounding are significant.
